# Memory Game
## Created with Python and Pygame

Code developed with this Youtube video https://youtu.be/IzsX89ZYGT0?si=2Ck2oSUSsQPhH7_V.  
This repository is part of a larger project during which I will attempt to create several
versions of the classic memory game using various frameworks for creating web apps with Python. 
Some of the frameworks I plan to explore include:

  1. Pygame (Python library for game creation).
  2. Reflex (Create web apps, including front and backend, fully in Python).
  3. Pyscript (Another tool for creating web apps with Python - from the Anaconda folks - can host on Pyscript.com)
  4. Flex (It's like Flutter for Python).
  5. Pygbag (This tool uses Webassembly to compile your Python code to a binary code format that will run in the browser)

## Deploying Memory-Pygame
Now that the basic game is completed I am going to deploy it in Github pages using Pygbag. I will document the process
below as I go.
